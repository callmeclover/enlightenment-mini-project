He had believed that the best form of government was a Democracy, and that government should be overthrown if they are corrupt.<br><br>The state of nature to him was bad, but he thought of it as more freeing, and the most free way to live.<br>He hated the idea of the social contract in the way that Hobbes viewed it, and believed everyone was born with natural rights; with those being life, liberty, and property."></p>
